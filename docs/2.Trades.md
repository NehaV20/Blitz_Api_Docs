The **Trades API** lets you retrieve all trade details executed under a given entity, strategy, or client.  
Using this API, you can monitor executed orders, pending trades, and their execution details in real time.

These endpoints let you **retrieve, filter, and monitor trade executions** efficiently.

| **Type** | **Endpoint** | **Description** |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|

## **Glossary / Notes**

- `trades` â†’ Refers to individual trade executions associated with strategies or entities.  
- Each trade represents one completed or pending transaction within a trading strategy.  
- Common fields like `order_side`, `status`, and `execution_type` help track the lifecycle of a trade.  
- Use filtering parameters (e.g., `entity_id`, `client_id`, `strategy_id`) to narrow results.
